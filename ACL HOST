Why filter
  Block malicious traffic
  Decrease load on network infrastructure
  Ensure data flows in an efficient manner
  Ensure data gets to intended recipients and only intended recipients
  Obfuscate network internals

Practical Applications
  Network Traffic - allow or block traffic to/from remote locations.
  Email addresses - to block unwanted email to reduce risk or increase productivity
  Computer applications in an organization environment - for security from vulnerable software
  MAC filtering - also for security to allow only specific computers access to a network

Default policies
  Explicit - precisely and clearly expressed
  Implicit - implied or understood

Blacklist/Whitelist
  Block-Listing (Formerly Black-List)
    Implicit ACCEPT
    Explicit DENY
  Allow-Listing (Formerly White-List)
    Implicit DENY
    Explicit ACCEPT

Filtering methods
  Stateless (Packet) Filtering (L3+4)
  Stateful Inspection (L4)
  Circuit-Level (L5)
  Application Layer (L7)
  Next Generation (NGFW) (L7)

Soft/Hard/Cloudware
  Software - typically host-based
  Hardware - typically network-based
  Cloud - provided as a service

hooks->chain
  NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING → PREROUTING
  NF_IP_LOCAL_IN → INPUT
  NF_IP_FORWARD → FORWARD
  NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT → OUTPUT
  NF_IP_POST_ROUTING → POSTROUTING

Tables of iptables
  filter - default table. Provides packet filtering.
  nat - used to translate private ←→ public address and ports.
  mangle - provides special packet alteration. Can modify various fields header fields.
  raw - used to configure exemptions from connection tracking.
  security - used for Mandatory Access Control (MAC) networking rules.

chains of ip tables
  PREROUTING - packets entering NIC before routing
  INPUT - packets to localhost after routing
  FORWARD - packets routed from one NIC to another. (needs to be enabled)
  OUTPUT - packets from localhost to be routed
  POSTROUTING - packets leaving system after routing

chains assigned to each table***********
  filter - INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT
  nat - PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, INPUT, and OUTPUT
  mangle - All chains
  raw - PREROUTING and OUTPUT
  security - INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT


    Before you flush change the default policy to accept

options for iptables
    iptables -t [table] -A [chain] [rules] -j [action]
-t - Specifies the table. (Default is filter)
-A - Appends a rule to the end of the list or below specified rule
-I - Inserts the rule at the top of the list or above specified rule
-R - Replaces a rule at the specified rule number
-D - Deletes a rule at the specified rule number
-F - Flushes the rules in the selected chain
-L - Lists the rules in the selected chain using standard formatting
-S - Lists the rules in the selected chain without standard formatting
-P - Sets the default policy for the selected chain
-n - Disables inverse lookups when listing rules
--line-numbers - Prints the rule number when listing rules
-p - Specifies the protocol
-i - Specifies the input interface
-o - Specifies the output interface
--sport - Specifies the source port
--dport - Specifies the destination port
-s - Specifies the source IP
-d - Specifies the destination IP
-j - Specifies the jump target action
  Table: filter*, nat, mangle
  Chain: INPUT, OUTPUT, PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, FORWARD
-i [ iface ]
-o [ iface ]
-s [ ip.add | Network/CIDR ]
-d [ ip.add | network/CIDR ]NPUT, OUTPUT, PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, FORWARD
-p icmp [ --icmp-type type# { /code# } ]
-p tcp [ --sport | --dport { port1 |  port1:port2 } ]
-p tcp [ --tcp-flags SYN,ACK,PSH,RST,FIN,URG,ALL,NONE ]
-p udp [ --sport | --dport { port1 | port1:port2 } ]
-m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED,UNTRACKED,INVALID
-m mac [ --mac-source | --mac-destination ] [mac]
-p [tcp|udp] -m multiport [ --dports | --sports | --ports { port1 | port1:port15 } ]
-m bpf --bytecode [ 'bytecode' ]
-m iprange [ --src-range | --dst-range { ip1-ip2 } ]
-j [ ACCEPT | REJECT | DROP ]
  ACCEPT - Allow the packet
  REJECT - Deny the packet (send an ICMP reponse)
  DROP - Deny the packet (send no response)

Flush table
  iptables -t [table] -F
Change default policy
  iptables -t [table] -P [chain] [action]
Lists rules with rule numbers
  iptables -t [table] -L --line-numbers
Lists rules as commands interpreted by the system
  iptables -t [table] -S

Inserts rule before Rule number
  iptables -t [table] -I [chain] [rule num] [rules] -j [action]
Replaces rule at number
  iptables -t [table] -R [chain] [rule num] [rules] -j [action]
Deletes rule at number
  iptables -t [table] -D [chain] [rule num]
