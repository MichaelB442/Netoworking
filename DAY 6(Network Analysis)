----Tools--
  Sensors
    In-line
    -Placed between communicating devices to stop attacks
    -Impacts network latency
    -Intrusion Prevention System(IPS)
    -Firewall
    -Test Access Point (TAP)
      -Appliance placed between 2 network devices
      -Best for packet collection with no data loss
      -Must be placed "in line" of network traffic
      -Not Scalable
      -Will need several installed to capture traffic for other network segments
    -Man-in-th-Middle (MitM)
      -Attacker can use ARP or some other method/protocol
      -Attackers can sniff or manipulate traffic that flows through them
      -Typically must be on the same network as the victim
      -Traffic capture is dependent on the attacker’s system and bandwidth

    Out of Band(Passive)
    -Monitor network segments
    -Can detect but can not stop
    -gets copies of network traffic
    -does not affect latency
    -Intrusion detection system(IDS)
    -Switched Port Analyzer(SPAN)
      -Configured on the network Switch
      -Best for packet collection of traffic from several switch ports at once
      -Scalable
      -Can have a high degree of packet loss
      -Places burden on the network Switch


----Identify Characteristics--
  Tools used for fingerprinting and host identification can be used passively(sniffing/fingerprinting) or actively(scanning)
  Active OS fingerprinting
    -Easier
    -Send packets to the target and monitor response
    -Tools:
      -Nmap
      -Xprobe2
      -sinfp3

  Passive OS fingerprinting
    -More difficult
    -Rely on sniffing packets
    -Tools:
      -p0f
      -Ettercap
      -PRADS

  Ports/Protocols
    -Windows
      -88 - Kerberos / Domain Controller
      -137/138/139 - NetBIOS
      -445 - SMB
    -Linux
      -22 - SSH
      -111 - SUN RPC
    -Ephemeral Ports
      -IANA 49152–65535
      -Linux 32768–60999
      -Windows XP 1025–5000
      -Win 7/8/10 use IANA
      -Win Server 2008 1025–60000
      -Sun Solaris 32768–65535


----Baselining--
  What is baselining
    -Snapshot of what the network looks like during a time frame
    -7 days to establish the initial snapshot
    -Prerequisite Information

  Objective
    -Determines the current state of your network
    -Ascertain the current utilization of network resources
    -Identify normal vs peak network traffic time frames
    -Verify port/protocol usage

  Performing
    -Preparation:
      -Network Diagram
      -Known Servers, Hosts, and Networking devices
      -Known IPs, ports, and protocols
      -Known forbidden IPs, ports, and protocols
      -Known traffic "flows"

  Scope and Objectives:
    -What traffic/protocols to capture?
    -Which network segments?
    -Which days?
    -What times?


----Methodologies--
  Hackers
    -Footprinting
    -Network scanning
    -Network Enumeration
    -Vulnerability Assessment

----Indicators--
  Indicator of Attack (IOA)
  -Proactive
  -A series of actions that are suspicious together
  -Focus on Intent
  -Looks for what must happen
    -Code execution. persistence, lateral movement, etc.
    -Destination IP/Ports
    -Public Servers/DMZs
    -Off-Hours
    -Network Scans
    -Alarm Events
    -Malware Reinfection
    -Remote logins
    -High amounts of some protocols
  
  Indicator of Compromise (IOC)
    -Reactive
    -Forensic Evidence
    -Provides Information that can change
      -Malware, IP addresses, exploits, signatures
    -.exe/executable files
    -NOP sled
    -Repeated Letters
    -Well Known Signatures
    -Mismatched Protocols
    -Unusual traffic
    -Large amounts of traffic/ unusual times
    -Unusual traffic outbound
    -Anomalous user login or account use
    -Size of responses for HTML
    -High number of requests for the same files
    -Using non-standard ports/ application-port mismatch
    -Writing changes to the registry/system files
    -Unexpected/unusual patching or tasks


----Anomolies--
  ICMP tunneling
    -ICMP PING uses Type 8 and Type 0
    -Both should be:
      -1 for 1
      -Same size and payload
    -Look out for:
      -Request/Reply imbalances
      -Abnormal/different payloads

  DNS tunneling
    -DNS uses Query/Response
      -1 Query typically gets 1 response
    -Look out for:
      -Query/Response imbalances
      -Abnormal/different payloads
      -Continuous Queries

  HTTP(s) Tunneling
    -HTTP is "bursty" in nature
    -Client issues request and the server responds
    -Look out for:
      -Steady connections
      -HTTPs you will need to check session establishment for abnormalities

  Beaconing
    -Call back to the C&C server
    -Gets/sends commands from/to C&C
    -Look out for:
      -Beacon Timing
        -Commonly at regular intervals
      -Beacon Size
        -Check-Ins may not have any payloads
        -Orders will have payloads
