Layer 2
  802.3(x)Ethernet
  802.11(x)Wireless
  802.5 Token Ring
  All considered LAN
    Can be broken down into MAC(Medium Access Control)/LLC(Logical Link Control)

Frames

How Switches affect the netowrk
  Builds a CAM
    A mac address table
  Forwards frames via MAC address
  Switch Modes
    Cut-Through -- forwards without waiting for whole packet
    Fragment-Free -- reads atleast 64 Bytes before forwarding
    Store and Forward -- reads whole packet then sends
  **ATTACK
      CAM Table Overflow Attack
        Send frames with bogus MAC addresses, Fills the CAM so the switch cannot relearn real MAC addresses

MAC ADDRESSES
  Length: 48-bit | 6 byte | 12 Hex
  Format:
      Windows: 01-23-45-12-34-56
      Unix/Linux: 01:23:45:12:34:56
      Cisco: 1234.5612.3456
      First 24-bits assigned by IANA (3 Octets)
      Vendor Assigns last 24(3 Octets)
  Unicast - 8th bit is off
  Multicast - 8th bit is on
  broadcast - all bits on
  Mac Spoofing
    mac names - Hardware, Firmware, Burned-in
    used to bu unchangable can now be changed w/ Software

Data-Link Frame Headers
  https://net.cybbh.io/public/networking/latest/01_data/fg.html#_1_3_6_describe_the_contents_of_an_ethernet_header_and_frame
VLAN
  Trunks connect VLANS
  Default vlan per port on a switch is VLAN1
  Data-User Traffic
  Voice- VOIP traffic
  Management - Switch and router management
  Native - Untagged switch and router traffic
  Adds a portion to the frame to define the vlan called a vlan tag 
      (https://net.cybbh.io/public/networking/latest/01_data/fg.html#_1_3_7_describe_an_802_1q_virtual_local_area_network_vlan_frame_and_how_its_frames_differ_from_a_standard_802_3_frame)
  you can also have two vlan tags
  **ATTACK
      VLAN HOPPING ATTACK
      Switch spoofing(DTP)
      Single Tagging
      Double Tagging (Using native VLAN)
ARP
  ARP (OP1/OP2)
  RARP(OP3/OP4)reverse
  Proxy ARP(OP2)can poison ARP CACHE
  Gratuitous ARP(OP2) can poison ARP CACHE

ARP CACHE
  All resolved MAC to IP resolutions
  If MAC is not in cache then ARP is used
  Dynamic entries last from 2-20 minutes
  Default gateway is present at minimum
  Can be easily duped by attackers

VTP - VLAN TRUNKING PROTOCOL
  Dynamically add/remove/modify VLANs
  Cisco proprietary
  Server
  Client
  Transparent
  Can cause switches to dump all VLAN information
  Cause a DoS as switch will not support configured VLANS

DTP - DYNAMIC TRUNKING PROTOCOL
  Dynamically create trunk links
  Cisco Proprietary
  Dynamic-Auto/Dynamic-Desirable
  On by default
  Can send messages to form a trunk
  Recommend - disable DTP Negotiations, manually assign Access or Trunk

CDP,FDP,AND LLDP
  Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)
  Foundry Discovery Protocol (FDP)
  Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)
  Leaks valuable information
  Clear Text
  Enabled by default
  Disable it:
      Globally
      Per interface
  May require it for VOIP

STP - SPANNING TREE PROTOCOL
  1. Elect root bridge
  2. identify root ports
  3. identify designated ports for segments
  4. set alternate ports to block

**ATTACK
Spanning-Tree Attack
  Crafted Bridge Protocol Data units (BPDU)
  Used to perform a DoS or MitM

PORT SECURITY MODES
  Shutdown(default)-has to be reenabled by an admin
  Protect - less privileges
  Restrict - less privileges/logs
  Uses:
    Restrict unauthorized access
    Limit MAC address learned on port
    Prevent CAM Table Overflow attacks
  Weaknesses:
    Dependent on MACs
    MAC spoofing

LAYER 2 attack mitigation
  Shutdown unused ports
  Enable Port Security 
  IP Source Guard
  Manually assign STP Root
  BPDU Guard
  DHCP snoopring
    Techniques:
      802.1x
      Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI)
      Static CAM entries
      Static ARP entries
      Disable DTP negotiations
      Manually assign Access/Trunk ports
      Network Access Complete

NETWORK LAYER
  Addressing Schemes
  Routing
  Encapsulation
  IP Fragmentation/Reassembly
  Error Handling/Diagnostics
    INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSIONS:
      *IPV4(ARPANET 1982)
        Classful subnetting
          -Class A (0 to 127)UNICAST
          -Class B (128 to 191)UNICAST
          -Class C (192 to 223)UNICAST
          -Class D (224 to 239) - Multicasting
          -Class E (240 to 255) - Not used
          -Broadcast IP IP with full host portion on
           https://git.cybbh.space/net/public/raw/master/modules/networking/slides-v4/images/IPv4_Header.png
        Classless subnetting(CIDR)
          Subnetting
            Network Portion/Host Portion
            Using Host bits as Subnet Bits
        NAT- Convert IP addresses
        Fragmentation
          Breaking up packets from higher MTU to lower MTU network
          Performed by routers
          MF flag is on from 1st until 2nd to last
          Offset is on from 2nd until the last
          Offset = (MTU - (IHL x 4)) ÷ 8
      *IPv6(Standardized 2017)
        Fragmentation
          IPv6 does not support fragmentation within it’s header
          Routers do not fragment IPv6 packets
          Source adjusts MTU to avoid fragmentation
          Source can use IPv6 fragmentation extension header

      Fragmentation Vulnerability
        Can use fragmentation overlaps to avoid firewall detection
        Attack depends on how OS deals with overlap
        Example: Teardrop attack
    IPV4 Auto Configuration
      APIPA
        169.254.0.0/16
      DHCP
        DORA Process
    TraceRoute ICMP,UDP,TCP

BGP
  Road-map of the Internet
  Routes traffic between Autonomous System (AS) Number
  Advertises IP CIDR address blocks
  Establishes Peer relationships
  Complicated configuration
  Complicated and slow path selection
  How BGP chooses the best path:
    Advertise a more specific route. 192.168.1.0 /24 is more specific than 192.168.0.0 /16.
    Offer a shorter route to certain blocks of IP addresses.
    A route to ip prefix with 4 AS 'hops" is better than route with 5 AS 'hops'
  Hijacking:
    Illegitimate advertising of addresses
    BGP propagates false information
    Purpose:
      stealing prefixes
      monitoring traffic
      intercept (and possibly modify) Internet traffic
      'black holing' traffic
      perform MitM
  Hijaking Defense
    IP prefix filtering
    BGP hijacking detection
      Tracking the change in TTL of incoming packets
      Increased Round Trip Time (RTT) which increases latency
      Monitoring misdirected traffic (change in AS path from tools like Looking Glass)
