*Lan Topologies: (How they are connected)*
  -Bus
    Straight connection

  -Star 
    Work stations connected to a central point

  -Ring
    Its a circle

  -Mesh 
    Everyone is connected

  -Wireless
    Its wireless, you have to be within range of "Hotspot"

  -Hierarchial
    Used for large scale networks
    Internet -> Core Layer -> Distribution Layer -> Access Layer

*Devices:
  -Hubs

  -Repeaters
    Push information further by amplifying signal

  -Switches
    Has many connections, avoids collisions and directs traffic where it needs to go rather than just blasting it out

  -Routers
    Allow networks to talk to eachother uses IP addresses

  802.5 Token Ring
  All considered LAN
    Can be broken down into MAC(Medium Access Control)/LLC(Logical Link Control)
